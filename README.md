# Fitness Watch Data Analysis
<p>Through this project I will be performing data analysis on fitness watch data using Python.</p>
<p>I will be analyzing information gathered from fitness wearables or smartwatches in order to extract valuable insights regarding users' health and activity trends. These wearable devices record various metrics, including steps taken, energy expended, walking speed, and additional data.</p>

<h3>Performing EDA to gain initial insights into the data:</h3>
  
<b>Step Count Over Time</b>

<b>Average step count per day</b>

<b>Walking efficiency over time</b>

<b>Step count and walking speed variations by time intervals</b>

<b>Comparing the daily average of all the health and fitness metrics:</b>

<p>Each rectangular tile in the graph above represents the different health and fitness metrics.</p>
<ul>The size of each tile corresponds to the value of the metric.</ul>
<ul>The colour of the tiles represents the metric itself.</ul> 
<ul>When interacting with the visualization, hovering over the tiles displays the exact average value for each metric.</ul>

<p>The Step Count metric has the largest tile in the visualization due to its generally higher values compared to the other metrics. Due to its large size the Step Count metric makes it difficult to visualize variations in the other metrics effectively. 
<p>As the value of step count is higher than the value of all other metrics, I plotted the visualization again omitting the Step Count metric:</p>

<b>Daily Averages for Different Metrics (Excluding Step Count):</b>

<h3> Conclusion: </h3>
<p>Through analyzing user data obtained from fitness wearables, companies can gain insights into user behavior, provide customized solutions, and play a role in enhancing the overall health and well-being of their users.</p>
